# **Energy Consumption Forecasting using Machine Learning**
This project uses machine learning techniques to forecast energy consumption data (PJME) from a time series dataset. The goal is to predict future energy consumption based on past observations. The project uses several methods including feature engineering, time series cross-validation, and XGBoost regression.

## Requirements
python```
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
```
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the PJME hourly energy consumption dataset, which contains hourly energy consumption data for the California electricity market from 2002-2018.
