## **Projects**

### 1. **Bitcoin and Ethereum Analysis**
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of Bitcoin and Ethereum price trends over time. It includes advanced techniques like resampling, rolling statistics, and exponential weighted moving averages (EWM) to analyze historical data and highlight key patterns.

- **Key Features:**
  - Time-based resampling for weekly and monthly trends.
  - Comparative analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.
  - Feature engineering for better insights.
  - Visualizations of moving averages, min-max bands, and more.

- **Dataset:** Historical price data for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

- **Tech Stack:**  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `seaborn`.

### 2. **Energy Consumption Forecasting**
This project forecasts hourly energy consumption using machine learning techniques, focusing on the PJME dataset. The goal is to predict future energy demand based on historical data using time series feature engineering and XGBoost regression.

- **Key Features:**
  - Time series cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
  - Feature engineering with lagged variables and rolling statistics.
  - Implementation of XGBoost regression for accurate predictions.

- **Dataset:** PJME Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset (2002â€“2018).  

- **Tech Stack:**  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`.
